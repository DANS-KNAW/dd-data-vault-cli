SYNOPSIS \u00b6 data-vault import start path/to/batch data-vault import status data-vault layer new DESCRIPTION \u00b6 This package provides the data-vault command, to interact with the dd-data-vault service via its REST API . INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently, this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL8 compatible OSes and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-data-vault-cli and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-data-vault-cli . The configuration options are documented by comments in the default configuration file config.yml . To install the module on systems that do not support RPM, you can copy and unarchive the tarball to the target host. You will have to take care of placing the files in the correct locations for your system yourself. For instructions on building the tarball, see next section. BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 17 or higher Maven 3.6.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/dd-data-vault-cli.git cd dd-data-vault-cli mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install . Alternatively, to build the tarball execute: mvn clean install assembly:single","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#data-vault","text":"Command line tool to interact with the dd-data-vault service.","title":"data-vault"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"data-vault import start path/to/batch data-vault import status data-vault layer new","title":"SYNOPSIS"},{"location":"#description","text":"This package provides the data-vault command, to interact with the dd-data-vault service via its REST API .","title":"DESCRIPTION"},{"location":"#installation-and-configuration","text":"Currently, this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL8 compatible OSes and later.
